# University-Data-Collection-With-Python
The following repository has been designed with the intent of university data collection for various research projects.

Code presented here focuses on the collection of information on Faculty members of the College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Each Python script allows a user to collect information on Faculty members of the College of Engineering for a selected department. When implemented, each script opens a Chrome browser, giving a user the chance to view the information collection process in real-time.
