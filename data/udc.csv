Taylor,"Assistant Professor, Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering","Bio I am a mechanical engineer who specializes in modern manufacturing, and throughout my career I have been driven by the interplay of form and function in good design. As an undergraduate working on a research project on tethered satellites, I discovered the world of honeycomb composite materials and porous sintered polymers. That is where I first learned that mechanical structure could imbue materials with novel and unexpected properties. After college, while working as mechanical design engineer, I practiced mechanical device design for reliability and ease of manufacture, working as the primary engineer on both medical products and consumer products. I developed my expertise in rapid prototyping and the broad range of techniques for molding and fabrication as well as factory control and automation. The interplay between medical tools and biological systems formed the foundation of my interest in research, and that interest drew me back to academia.When I returned to graduate school, I focused on microfabrication and biomechanics. At the microscale, the force of gravity is negligible, flow is largely laminar and motion is damped. The microscale world is a universe of its own, and there are countless opportunites for fabrication of novel microstructured materials. During my Ph.D., I fabricated microscale sensors for the functional assessment of stem cell derived cardiomyocytes. I utilized sacrificial layers to define the mechanical loading of single heart muscle cells and to perform the first purely axial, contractile force measurements on immature and stem cell derived cardiomyocytes. I calibrated these sensors using piezoresistive cantilevers and achieved both accurate and precise measurements of nanoNewton-level forces. I also created planar, stretchable biosensors that physically route metal traces away from areas of large strain and achieve constant, stretch-independent electrical properties.As a postdoctoral fellow, I worked at the nanoscale, studying the effects of mutations on cardiac contractile protein. In order to study the emergent mechanics of the multiprotein, acto-myosinc contractile system, I have worked to develop a DNA origami based synthetic cardiac sarcomere that will allow us to observe the cooperative behavior of motors as we scale up towards larger, more biomimetic systems.As a professor I utilize DNA origami (bottom up manufacturing) to enable nanomanufacturing and nanomechanics of multiprotein systems. I will also continue my investigations into microstructures for biomimetic sensors and actuators (top down manufacturing). The future of manufacturing involves manufacturing across scales, and I am excited to be part of it.          ","Research In the Taylor lab we develop dynamic micro- and nanosystems for enabling novel applications in biometry,  force spectroscopy, and cardiovascular biomechanics.

74,Carnegie Mellon University,College of Engineering,Civil & Environmental Engineering,Faculty,Hae Young Noh,"Associate Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering","Bio Hae Young Noh is an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering with a courtesy appointment in the Electrical and Computer Engineering. Her research introduced the new concept of “structures as sensors” to enable physical structures (e.g., buildings and vehicle frames) to be user- and environment-aware. In particular, these structures indirectly sense humans and surrounding environments through their structural responses (i.e., vibrations) by inferring the desired information (e.g., human behaviors, environmental conditions, heating and cooling system performance), instead of directly measuring the sensing targets with additional dedicated sensors (e.g., cameras, motion sensors). This concept brought a paradigm shift in how we view these structures and how the structures interact with us. Traditionally, structures that we inhabit (such as buildings or vehicles) are considered as passive and unchanging objects that we need to monitor and control, utilizing a dense set of sensors to collect information. This has often been complicated by “noise” caused by the occupants and environments. For example, building vibrations induced by indoor and outdoor environmental and operational conditions (e.g., people walking around, traffic outside, heating system running, etc.), have been often seen as noise that needs to be removed in traditional building science and structural engineering; however, they are a rich source of information about structure, users, environment, and resources. Similarly, in vehicle engineering, researchers and engineers have been investigating control and dynamics to reduce vehicle vibration for safety and comfort. However, vibrations measured inside vehicles contain information about transportation infrastructure, vehicle itself, and driver. Nohs work utilizes this “noise” to empower the structures with the ability to perceive and understand the information about users and surroundings using their own responses, and actively adopt and/or interact to enhance their sustainability and the occupants quality of life. Since she utilizes the structure itself as a sensing medium, information collection involves a simpler set of hardware that can be easily maintained throughout the structural lifetime. However, the analysis of data to separate the desired information becomes more challenging. This challenge is addressed through high-rate dynamic sensing and multi-source inferencing. Ultimately, her work aims to allow structural systems to become general sensing platforms that are easier and more practical to deploy and maintain in a long-term. At Stanford University, Noh received her PhD and MS degrees in the CEE department and her second MS degree in Electrical Engineering. Noh earned her BS in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. ",,

PhD student John Siirola (co directed with Steinar Hauan) demonstrated the synergy of using many types of collaborating agents to solve complex single and multi-objective optimization problems.   This work demonstrated that the approach truly parallelizes - using 100 computers solved problems, such as designing a chip-based chemical separator, 100 times faster than using one computer.  Collaborating diverse agents solved problems seven to eight times faster still, while including multiple formulations enhanced performance by another factor of two to three. Work in the n-dim group has developed information modeling environments and LIRE . These systems support collaboration, history-keeping, design environment evolution, and event-handling for distributed teams of engineers carrying complex work processes such as design. ",,

We are seeing an increasing number of new systems that interact directly with the environment where poor performance, unanticipated results and failure can be catastrophic. In the spirit of systems research, I like to design, implement and evaluate these types of systems in order to truly understand them.  Recently, I have been working on developing large-scale sensor networks and their supporting technologies that are energy-efficient and provide real-time properties. Sensor networks are a practical mechanism for bringing contextual information and new abilities to the already numerous embedded systems that surround us. They have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of application areas ranging from transportation and critical infrastructure monitoring to smart buildings and microgrids. One of our core focuses is on precise timing and navigation to support localization in GPS-denied environments like inside buildings.

167,Carnegie Mellon University,College of Engineering,Electrical & Computer Engineering,Faculty,Aswin Sankaranarayanan,"Associate Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering","Bio My research deals with understanding the interaction of light with materials, devising theories and imaging architectures to capture these interactions, and finally developing a deeper understanding of the world around us based on these interactions. While these interactions involve very high-dimensional signals, there are underlying structures that enable them to be modeled parsimoniously using low-dimensional models. My research identifies low-dimensional models for high-dimensional visual signals using both physics-based and learning-based formulates, and develop imaging architectures and algorithms that exploit these low-dimensional models for efficient sensing and inference.

Much research on intelligence emphasizes brain plasticity, the ability to respond and adapt to new information.     Tuesday, March 13, 2018 The learning brain is less flexible than we thought New research from CMU and Pitt reveals that the brain has various mechanisms and constraints by which it reorganizes its neural activity when learning over the course of a few hours. The new research finds that, when learning a new task, the brain is less flexible than previously thought.     Tuesday, August 29, 2017 Yu receives NSF grant for brain research The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently awarded BME/ECE’s Byron Yu and Professor Matthew Smith from the University of Pittsburgh nearly $500,000 to conduct a research project, titled “Volitional Modulation of neural activity in the visual cortex.” For their project, Yu and Smith will use a brain-computer interface (BCI) to identify which aspects of the brain’s activity are sensory versus cognitive.

Ph.D. 1965, University of Wales, U.K. M.Sc., 1958, Sangor University, India B.Sc. 1956, Mysore University, India  Research  Technology is an important ingredient for the growth of an economy. Technology diffuses through learning, work experience, and availability of the appropriate infrastructure. Professor Arunachalams present program of research is aimed at understanding the various components that make up this infrastructure and the specificity of technology in determining growth. Such technologies can indeed form the core technology for a society. The object is to understand the role of national and industrial policies and government intervention in choosing technologies. Another issue is the problem of technology transfer and identifying the conditions necessary for successful transfer. Here again, the choice of technology will be studied in the context of national policies and priorities. A related interest involves the problem of building infrastructure in developing economies, most notably electric power and telecommunications. Professor Arunachalams research in these areas includes the choice of technologies, investment options, assessment of viability and evaluation of public good. Publications  V.S. Arunachalam and S.

(5-year degree) in Environmental Engineering, IST, Portugal  Research Dr. Azevedo’s research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

Starting from traditional cellular mobile telephone networks we ""challenge"" this paradigm along several dimensions that allows us to better understand their behavior. Current wireless networking trends are pushing along these dimensions and so we can better understand how to build out these future networks. Here are several examples of these dimensions: 1. What happens when the basic infrastructure of base stations becomes more and more sparse?With more sparseness, connectivity starts to depend on peer relaying and physically carrying messages to get them to their destination. If there is mobility, some network resources can be dynamically repositioned to maintain connectivity. How do we control these mobile resource? What protocols are required? If mobile nodes are, for instance, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles, what role does the FAA play? 2. What happens when there is insufficient spectrum to communicate? Dynamic spectrum access allows a network to draw on a broader set of spectrum resources. One model of dynamic spectrum access is so-called policy-based radios. How are these spectrum policies generated and specified? How do we avoid harming other radio services? How is harm even defined? 3. What happens when networks are set up with little or no planning?The good old days of homogeneous base stations arranged in regular grids are long gone. Tiny femto cells mix with big macro cells, Cellphones mix with WiFi. Base stations are placed wherever they are needed. How do we make sense of this? Should we expect it to work? Will I have good coverage and throughput? How does this compare to the good old days? Will the billions of sensors in the Internet of Things be the technology that finally makes it fall apart? Cutting across these questions we try to understand (a) how they will really work through building prototypes and designing implementation architectures, (b) the effect on performance through analyzing the underlying theory, (c) the policy implications as we impact on existing systems, and (d) the security considerations as each of these challenges opens up new attack surfaces. His recent research funding includes NSF, DOE, and industry. Projects include the role of mobility in network control of unmanned aircraft, denial of service vulnerabilities in wireless protocols, spectrum policy frameworks for cognitive radios, and stochastic geometry applied to wireless networks.

Her specific research areas are social network analysis, dynamic network analysis, agent-based modeling, computational social and organization theory, adaptation and evolution, social network text mining, cyber security and the impact of telecommunication technologies and policy on communication, information diffusion, disease contagion and response within and among groups particularly in disaster or crisis situations.  She and members of her center have developed novel tools and technologies for analyzing large-scale geo-centric dynamic-networks and various multi-agent simulation systems.  These tools include: ORA, a statistical and graphical toolkit for analyzing and visualizing multi-dimensional networks and time-varying networks;  AutoMap, a text-mining system for extracting semantic networks from texts and then cross-classifying them using an organizational ontology into the underlying social, knowledge, resource and task networks; CEMAP, a system for extracting networks from email and blogs; and SORASCS, a service oriented plus architecture for designing and sharing workflows in the human socio-cultural space. Her simulation models meld multi-agent technology with network dynamics and empirical data. Three of the large-scale multi-agent network models she and the CASOS group have developed are: BioWar  a city-scale dynamic-network agent-based model for understanding the spread of disease and illness due to natural epidemics, chemical spills and weaponized biological attacks; Construct  an agent-based dynamic-network based model for assessing network evolution and the diffusion of information and beliefs under diverse socio-demographic and media environments; and RTE a model for examining state failure and the escalation of conflict at the city, state, nation and international as changes occur within and among red, blue and green forces. Dr. Carley is the director of the center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS) which has over 25 members, both students and research staff. She is the founding co-editor of the journal Computational Organization Theory and has co-edited several books in the computational organizations and dynamic network area.

(Engineering and Policy) 1996, Washington University in St. Louis  Research My research focuses on usable privacy and security. My current projects fall into several overlapping areas: privacy decision making (including applications of P3P), user-controllable security and privacy (including location-sharing privacy and file access control in the home), and usable cyber trust indicators, and and usable and secure passwords. Prior to coming to CMU I did research on P3P, electronic voting, security vulnerabilities in the movie production and distribution proces, and other topics.

Research Dr. Ferreiras work focuses on how people use technology to consume experience goods and influence others to do so. These are inextricably linked to how firms behave and how public policies affect market structures. His work focuses on the application of robust empirical identification methods to analyze large datasets obtained from organic in-vivo large-scale network-centric randomized experiments. Most of Dr. Ferreiras research spans two interrelated applied areas. He is interested in the Impact of Information and Communication Technologies on Education (IICTE) and in Peer-Influence and Consumption in the Media Industry (PICMI). The bulk of his work is in medialytics — using big data to understand the future of the media industry. In addition, Dr. Ferreiras has also been studying Competition, Consumer Churn and Switching Costs (CCCSC) in telecommunications.

Fischbeck,"Professor, Social and Decision Sciences, Engineering and Public Policy","Bio   Carnegie Mellon 1990-  Education   Ph.D. (Industrial Engineering/Engineering Management) 1991, Stanford University. M.S. (Operations Research) 1981, Naval Postgraduate School B.S. (Architecture) 1974, University of Virginia  Research Professor Fischbeck applies the tools of decision analysis and behavioral social science to policy problems, paying particular attention to the quantification and communication of uncertainty. This work covers both theoretical improvements to decision analysis and numerous applied real world problems.  Using a systems approach, Professor Fischbeck has studied a variety of topical problems. Working closely with graduate students, he has quantified the pollution caused by international shipping and is investigating several engineering and economic solutions. He is Director of the Center for the Study and Improvement of Regulation and has an active research program in understanding and improving risk communication and the design of effective decision support systems.  Recently, he has studied the actual and perceived risks of mine subsidence in Western Pennsylvania, insurance-buying behavior in the United States and Japan, warning labels on paint strippers, and the health and environmental concerns of citizens in the Pittsburgh area. Other work includes an investigation of organizational reliability from a probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) perspective. A PRA study is often used to understand the reliability of a technical system (like the space shuttle), but it is only by including the organizational features that a true understanding of the risk and failure modes can be modeled.  Other work includes an investigation of organizational reliability from a probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) perspective. A PRA study is often used to understand the reliability of a technical system (like the space shuttle), but it is only by including the organizational features that a true understanding of the risk and failure modes can be modeled. This more global perspective allows for the establishment of priorities for the allocation of a wide range of scarce resources including money, time, supervisory personnel, and test equipment.

Fuchs is a Professor in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, and was the founding Faculty Director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Manufacturing Futures Initiative – an initiative across six schools aimed to revolutionize the commercialization and local production of advanced manufactured products. Her research focuses on the development, commercialization and global manufacturing of emerging technologies, and national policy in that context. Dr. Fuchs was selected in 2012 as World Economic Forum Young Scientist (top 40 under 40, internationally). Over the past decade, Dr. Fuchs has played a growing role in national and international meetings on the future of advanced manufacturing, including being one of 23 participants in the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology workshop that led to the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, and serving on the expert group that supported the White House in the 2016 Innovation Dialogue between the U.S. and China. She currently serves on the National Academies’ National Materials and Manufacturing Board; the World Economic Forum’s Future of Production Global Futures Council; the Academic Advisory Board for M.I.T.’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, of which M.I.T.’s Technology Policy Program is a part; and the Advisory Editorial Board for Research Policy. Before coming to CMU, Dr. Fuchs completed her Ph.D. in Engineering Systems at M.I.T. in June 2006. She received her Masters and her Bachelors degrees also from M.I.T. in Technology Policy (2003) and Materials Science and Engineering (1999), respectively. Dr. Fuchs spent 1999-2000 as a fellow at the United Nations in Beijing, China. She grew up and attended K-12 in the Reading Public School District in Reading, PA. Her work has been published among other places in Science, the Nature journals, Research Policy, and Management Science; and has been covered on National Public Radio and in the New York Times.

206,Carnegie Mellon University,College of Engineering,Engineering and Public Policy,Faculty,Alex Hills,"Distinguished Service Professor, Engineering and Public Policy, Electrical and Computer Engineering","Bio  Carnegie Mellon 1992-   Dr. Alex Hills and his team built the world’s first big Wi-Fi network. As described in his book, Wi-Fi and the Bad Boys of Radio , the team overcame major obstacles to create the first wireless campus.  It was an unheard of idea when Hills started the project in 1993.  The new network, which came to be called “Wireless Andrew,” was the prototype used by many others to build Wi-Fi networks now in use around the world. Before he joined Carnegie Mellon, Professor Hills spent several years living in remote areas of Alaska and working to provide modern broadcasting and telecommunications services to the many small villages spread across the big state. He fought Alaska’s difficult weather and terrain, and helped to persuade some reluctant executives, in order to make the services possible. He tells of these adventures in his new book, Finding Alaska’s Villages: And Connecting Them. Dr. Hills is actively involved in international development. As a senior advisor to the ""Technology Consulting in the Global Community"" program, he works with Carnegie Mellon students on a broad array of projects in developing nations. This work is described in his book Geeks on a Mission.  It was the subject of his keynote speech at the 2015 Information Networking Institute graduation ceremony. Professor Hills has served as Vice Provost and Chief Information Officer at Carnegie Mellon, founding director of the universitys Information Networking Institute, Alaskas Deputy Commissioner of Administration and chief telecommunications official, and a US Army officer and company commander in South Korea.  Education   Ph.D. 1979, Carnegie Mellon University M.S. 1969, Arizona State University B.S. 1964, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute  Research  Dr. Hills has written and lectured on the potential for wireless to deliver basic telephone service in the developing world and on its implications for anytime-anywhere computing.  He has broad experience in information technology, including both technical and business aspects. And he is an expert in telecommunications policy, which encompasses aspects of engineering, law and economics Working with colleagues, Professor Hills also developed a methodology for designing Wi-Fi networks.  He invented a semi-automated design tool called “Rollabout” to dramatically improve and speed up the Wi-Fi network design process. He holds 18 patents and has helped industry partneres to improve the performance of their Wi-Fi equipment and networks.

Krishnan’s work on helping create innovative organizations include his service for six years beginning in 2002 as advisor to the Dean of a new School of Information Systems created by the Government of Singapore within Singapore Management University. Drawing on a partnership with Carnegie Mellon, the work helped the school recruit faculty, develop innovative curricula and meta curricula and establish best practices for governance of the School. Krishnan’s leadership experience include the founding of the information systems and management program at Carnegie Mellon, and his term as the First Dean of the Heinz College, a unique college that is home to both the Public Policy School and Information Systems School at Carnegie Mellon. This unique co-location of information technology, public policy and management brings together a multi-disciplinary faculty consisting of engineers, social scientists and information technologists dedicated to educating “men and women of intelligent action.” Faculty and students address important issues at the nexus of information technology, policy and management that arise in domains such as information privacy, evidence-based health care delivery, and urban consumer behavior. The College’s global footprint in the US (Pittsburgh and Washington D.C.), in Singapore and in Adelaide, Australia enable these issues to be addressed from a global point of view using international testbeds and via bi-continental educational programs. INFORMS, the Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences, the leading organization of scholars and practitioners of analytics, recognized the Heinz College in 2016 with the UPS George D. Smith Prize for educational excellence. It is the only education institution that is home to both the Von Neumann Theory Prize and the UPS George D. Smith Prize from INFORMS. Krishnan led the establishment of funded research centers focused on data driven decision making in key societal domains including transportation (http://traffic21.heinz.cmu.edu/), smart cities (http://www.ices.cmu.edu/metro21/), and living analytics (http://larc.heinz.cmu.edu), and Risk and Regulatory Services Innovation. He has participated in the World Economic Forum, the CES, and a summary of his ideaslab presentation is at http://goo.gl/IqkMKR. A recent interview on Big Data with NDTV is at http://goo.gl/WyxEi3 He has also led a successful fund raising campaign that continues to transform the learning spaces, classrooms, faculty and staff offices and lab spaces in Hamburg Hall, the home of the Heinz College on the CMU campus.

Research I work for the Silicon Valley campus of Carnegie Mellon in the Information Networking Institute, which is part of the engineering college. My primary responsibilities are around the practicum offerings, where we pair student teams with external clients. I research topics in Internet privacy and security. I work to contribute to a more coherent picture of how, why, and when people make choices about protecting themselves online, and what that means to them. My interests span users mental models of online interaction, study of and creation of usable tools to support online decision making, and how people learn about and reason about online trust issues. In addition to technical tools, I focus on technically informed policy approaches in standards bodies, regulatory agencies, and legislation in the United States and European Union nations.

Granger Morgan is the Hamerschlag University Professor of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.  He holds appointments in three academic units: the Department of Engineering and Public Policy; the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering; and the H. John Heinz III College.  His research addresses problems in science, technology and public policy with a particular focus on energy, electric power, environmental systems, climate change, the adoption of new technologies, and risk analysis.  Much of his work has involved the development and demonstration of methods to characterize and treat uncertainty in quantitative policy analysis.  At Carnegie Mellon, Morgan co-directs (with Inês Azevedo) the NSF Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making and (with Jay Apt) the universitys Electricity Industry Center. Morgan is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. At the National Academies, he serves as the NAS co-chair of the Report Review Committee and has chaired a variety of consensus studies.  Morgan is a member of the board for the International Risk Governance Council Foundation and of the Advisory Board for the E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen.  He is a member of the DOEs Electricity Advisory Committee and of the Energy Advisory Committee of PNNL.  In the past, he served as Chair of the Science Advisory Board of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and as Chair of the Advisory Council of the Electric Power Research Institute.  He is a Fellow of the AAAS, the IEEE, and the Society for Risk Analysis.  He holds a BA from Harvard College (1963) where he concentrated in Physics, an MS in Astronomy and Space Science from Cornell (1965) and a Ph.D. from the Department of Applied Physics and Information Sciences at the University of California at San Diego (1969).

217,Carnegie Mellon University,College of Engineering,Engineering and Public Policy,Faculty,Jon M. Peha,"Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Courtesy Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering","Bio  Carnegie Mellon 1991-   Jon Peha has addressed information networks from positions in industry, government, and academia. In government, he served at the Federal Communications Commission as Chief Technologist, in the White House as Assistant Director of the Office of Science & Technology Policy, in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, and at USAID where he helped launch and lead a US Government interagency program to assist developing countries with information infrastructure. In industry, he has been Chief Technical Officer for three high-tech companies. At Carnegie Mellon, he is a Professor in the Dept. of Engineering & Public Policy and the Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, and former Associate Director of the universitys Center for Wireless & Broadband Networking.  Dr. Peha is an IEEE Fellow and an AAAS Fellow, and was selected by AAAS as one of 40 Featured Science and Technology Policy Fellows of the last 40 years (""40@40""). He has received the FCCs ""Excellence in Engineering Award,"" the IEEE Communications Society TCCN Publication Award for career contributions, and the Brown Engineering Medal.  Education   Ph.D. (Electrical Engineering, minor in Computer Science), Stanford University M.S. (Electrical Engineering), Stanford University B.Sc./B.A. (Engineering/Computer Science), Brown University  Research Professor Pehas research addresses social and policy issues that are inseparable from the technological evolution of computer and telecommunications networks. One such area is wireless systems. A shortage of available spectrum impedes the creation of valuable new wireless products and services. This shortage can be greatly alleviated through new spectrum policies that take advantage of emerging technology, and especially the potential for spectrum sharing. Another area of wireless research concerns the communications systems used by emergency responders, such as firefighters, paramedics, and police. Changes to both technologies and policies associated with these systems can save lives, as well lowering costs and conserving spectrum.  A third area of Professor Peha’s wireless research addresses vehicular networks. If motor vehicles can establish wireless links between each other, and with roadside devices, they can collectively create an important new form of wireless infrastructure to be used for anything from automotive safety to Internet access. Professor Peha’s research interests also include broadband networks, which have blurred the traditional distinctions between Internet, cable TV, and telephony. Research issues include policies intended to promote fair and open competition such as “network neutrality,” universal service policies intended to help underserved communities and individuals (in both developed and developing countries), policies intended to advance security or privacy, and surveillance polices that must both help law enforcement and intelligence agencies do their jobs and protect the privacy and security of individuals and organizations. Evolution of wireless and broadband networks can spark the creation of new applications that revolutionize industries and policies. In this realm, Professor Peha is researching the dissemination of copyrighted material over broadband networks, and its technical and policy implications. He has also considered Internet payment systems, and the related complexities of bringing financial services to people without bank accounts, enforcing tax law on electronic commerce, protecting privacy, enhancing security, and combating fraud. Broadband has also facilitated the growth of less desirable applications, such as spyware, spam, and viruses, that must be considered. Publications  J. M.

Department Head and Raymond J. Lane Distinguished Professor, Mechanical Engineering;","Bio   Carnegie Mellon 1998-   Professor Robinson joined Carnegie Mellon in 1998 after working for two years as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Laboratories. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in Mechanical Engineering in 1996 and his B.S. in Civil Engineering from Stanford University in 1990. Dr. Robinson received the Ahrens Career Development Chair in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005 and the George Tallman Ladd Outstanding Young Faculty Award from Carnegie Mellon University in 2000. He has received substantial research support from EPA, DOE, NSF, DoD, and the Allegheny County Health Department.    Education   B.S. (Civil Engineering) Stanford University, 1990 M.S. (Mechanical Engineering), University of California at Berkeley, 1993 Ph.D. (Mechanical Engineering), University of California at Berkeley, 1996.  Research  Professor Allen Robinsons research examines the technical and policy issues related to energy and the environment. A current focus is fine particulate matter – 50,000 Americans are estimated to die prematurely each year from fine particle pollutant and almost 70 million people in the United States live in areas that violate the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for fine particle mass. Atmospheric particles also have a controlling influence on Earth’s climate and degrade visibility. Air Quality and Particulate Matter A major thrust of Prof. Robinson’s research is characterizing fine particle emissions from combustion systems such as diesel engines. Laboratory experiments using dilution samplers and a smog chamber have revealed a dynamic new picture for primary organic aerosol emissions, in which these emissions evaporate, oxidize, and recondense over time. These findings require updated approaches to measure and simulate emissions from combustion systems. His group is working to implement this revised framework into chemical transport models to investigate its implications on our understanding of urban, regional and global air quality. This modeling has revealed a potentially important new source of regional oxidized and presumably hydrophilic organic aerosol. Work is ongoing to better understand the health consequences and climate effects of these pollutants. Prof. Robinson also works on quantifying the sources of ambient air pollution, a critical step to developing effective regulations. This research integrates field measurements with receptor- and emission-based modeling to better understand sources of organic aerosol. An emerging effort utilizes highly time resolved measurements of volatile and semivolatile organic compounds in source apportionment models. His group is also conducting smog chamber studies to investigate the photochemical stability of molecular markers commonly used for source apportionment. The ultimate goal is to develop more cost-effective regulatory strategies. Biomass Energy & Global Climate Prof. Robinson is also interested in biomass energy. Biomass (wood, agricultural residues, and fast-growing ""energy"" crops) is a renewable energy resource that is CO2-neutral, if utilized in a sustainable manner. He has worked extensively on cofiring biomass and coal in existing coal-fired utility boilers. Cofiring represents a near-term pathway for dramatically increasing our utilization of biomass energy. He is also working on a project to characterize air pollutant emissions from engines operating on ethanol-gasoline blends and biodiesel. The laboratory data will be implemented in air quality models to assess the impacts of widespread adoption of alternative fuels on urban and regional air quality to help inform future policy decisions. Interdisciplinary Collaboration Much of Prof. Robinson’s research is conducted as part of the Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies (CAPS) at Carnegie Mellon University. Strengths of the Center include the close coupling between science and policy, and extensive interplay between experiment and modeling. This interdisciplinary Center involves five core faculty members and more than 25 graduate and post-doctoral fellows in four engineering departments and the chemistry department. The Center is tightly integrated, with a large shared laboratory, weekly group seminars, and many students being co-advised by multiple faculty members. Publications  A.L. Robinson, N.M.

Doug has published extensively in the fields of networking, wireless systems, network security and network policy and has maintained a well-funded research program through NSF, DARPA and other sources.  Education   Ph.D., University of Pittsburgh, 2001 M.S., University of Pittsburgh, 1993 B.S., University of Pittsburgh, 1988  Research  I work at the intersection of network technology and public policy, an area rich in technically challenges and socially significant research topics. At the highest level, my research interests are as follows: Dynamic Spectrum Access: Developing new models of spectrum management and methods for enabling coexistence among radio services. Of particular interest is coexistence with legacy systems, including interoperability and compatibility between federal and non-federal systems. I am currently developing new technical models and policies to address interference limits between legacy services and emerging new services. I plan to explore methods of reallocation based on coexistence, cooperation and/or interference tolerance. Security and Privacy: Developing models to address security concerns in emerging dynamic spectrum access systems. Defining risk attributed to new dynamic spectrum access technology. Exploring jamming and anti-jamming mechanisms through dynamic spectrum access technology. Assessing consumer understanding of privacy online. Measuring the demand and willingness to pay for online privacy. Broadband networking: Exploiting the huge data sets that exist (within network operators) to assess the operation of the Internet. With access to the right data sets, there are hundreds of questions to ask and answer about the operation of the Internet. Exploring new models for growth of edge services and cloud operations (IPv6, IoT, high speed broadband, SDN…). Apply SDN controller architectures to wireless networking problems such as handoff, configuration, network management and transcoding. Network policy: Implementing data-driven decision-making. Adopting process transparency and accountability. Assessing new models for communicating privacy and security attributes to consumers. Reforming radio spectrum management. Below is a set of example topics I would like to explore: 1. Is it possible to convert customary transmitter-power constraints into receiver interference limits? This is the question of, “how do we move interference issues from the transmitter to the receiver?” What method might we consider for negotiating towards maximizing social surplus? 2. Would a spectrum model based on interference limits offer any advantage in terms of improving spectrum use -mitigating conflicts, maximizing utility…? 3. What interference threshold models are acceptable? Traditionally conservative thresholds are set at a high false positive; interference is strongly dependent on the starting assumptions (metrics, measurement, thresholds, models...). How might other thresholds be justified? 4. Does beamforming actually reduce a threat in the face of rogue jamming devices? What are the limits of high efficiency in spectrum reuse from beamforming in live radio environments? 5. Develop an initial test-bed facility to study and investigate the possibilities of shared spectrum access between disparate users. The desire is to build upon this capability and make it a repeatable process so that collected information, lessons-learned, and its applicable infrastructure can be re-used for future experimentations and/or demonstrations. It is envisioned to expand this capability into a transparent, comprehensive and distributed testing & demonstration environment that seeks to leverage current and future technologies as a means to model, simulate and/or perform live experimentation. Can a red team / black team approach be used to assess spectrum testbeds? Establish two teams that are intended to focus on different sides of a spectrum problem. 6. What enforcement and monitoring programs make sense for the FCC in the future? There are at least two very different areas to consider – future of broadcast decency issues AND spectrum enforcement – and the models for each will likely diverge. 7. Is there a future model of dense small cells in urban areas that may be community/end-user deployed, which is not solely controlled by, and may be independent of, carriers? What would it take to enable? Why cant I have a home router with Sprint, VZW, AT&T, WiFi, 3.5GBps, etc. radios that I (as an end-user) can manage? What complementary infrastructure (poles with power for antennas and backhaul siting, maybe collocated at anchor institutions) is needed to have to make this work? How can this alternative model of community-level wide-area (i.e., not just in my home) wireless connectivity grow and interconnect with provider models? 8. What is a functional mixed model of spectrum regulation? One could look at legacy spectrum allocation as a very static database approach to spectrum management (the allocation tables are the dbase and it changes slowly and at great expense), versus a full-blown cognitive radio vision as sensor-enabled handsets that negotiate spectrum access in real-time. Reality is somewhere in between. What are the economics of this future and what has to change in technology, business and policy to allow for it? 9. How much to sense and sample in cognitive radios? Examine the problems and performance of wideband spectrum sensing methods (Nyquist and sub-Nyquist sampling sensing methods) under situations of high Doppler and time-varying characteristics of links caused by high relative mobility between nodes, as well as the multipath effect caused by complex terrain environment. 10. What is the role of compressive sensing in cognitive radios? In wideband multi-channel networks, could one use compressive sensing-based channel estimation and signal detection methods to alleviate processing overhead and the requirement of ADC, DSP or FPGA, to achieve the Space-time-frequency spectrum reusing and dynamic spectrum management. Because the sensing object is the signal with a known modulation, we might not need to accurately reconstruct the signal, rather just extract the characteristic parameter of wideband wireless signal, and then determine the channel and what modulation mode is used with a much smaller processing overhead. 11. How might we improve the adjacent channel selectivity for whitespace receivers in a cost effective manner? How selective do these devices really need to be given the current and future legacy receivers? 12. A few thoughts on research relating to broadband access: Is it possible to create inexpensive, simple and mutable broadband access edge equipment? How might Software Defined Networking be used as a tool to create and manage simple broadband access equipment (wireless AP, cable modems, optical terminals…) based on technology that can allow the network edge to evolve and adapt. Can we use NetfFow and/or other data sources to assess interconnection conflicts? Examine the role of empirical data analysis of traffic flows across the Internet. Can we use BGP as an IGP for cloud and data center routing? Examine the application of policy based routing in environments with diverse application and content sources. I’m interested in the many issues surrounding privacy on networked systems. I’m interested in understanding how to better inform policy makers with the right set of data and analysis of that data, “data driven policy”. 13. I also work on applying decision analysis and cost benefit analysis to problems in the ICT policy space. These problems, such as network interconnection and the provision of societally beneficial (accessibility or emergency) services, are complex in terms of incentives and associated cost or pricing issues. 14. An arguably less academically rigorous interest of mine involves helping policymakers understand the technical and economic aspects of networked systems. Sometimes this work can take the form of technical tutorials (e.g., how a technology works) and other times it can involve diving deeply into the potential problems that might arise because of policy decisions that don’t appreciate the implications of an emerging technology.

M.S. (Electrical Engineering) 1968, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Research  Professor Sirbu coordinates a research program in telecommunications information technology, policy and management. The research is concerned with how public policies influence the deployment of new information technologies, and conversely, what public policies are required to accommodate new technological developments. For example, local exchange competition is being facilitated by new technologies for delivering integrated voice, data and video over fiber optic, coaxial cable, twisted pair, or wireless networks. Engineering economic models of alternative local telecommunication network architectures are used to examine issues of comparative economics, economies of scale and scope, and impact of regulatory policies governing competitive entry, unbundling, and interconnection.  The rise of integrated gigabit networks requires new approaches to the regulation and pricing of telecommunications services. Old regulatory models which treat telephony, packet switching and cable services differently for regulatory purposes must be revised when all information types are reduced to data bits. We are exploring the regulatory implications of Next Generation Network (NGN) technologies (e.g. packet-switched over fiber) and the implications of integrated networks for regulatory policy. Pricing of integrated networks is explored through formal and empirical models of network supply and demand that can lead to efficient and practical pricing structures for both unicast and multicast traffic.  Broadband networks are becoming more central to knowledge-based economies. We are exploring the impact on economic growth of the availability and use of broadband by combining broadband deployment data with economic census data. We are also concerned with how to revise universal service support mechanisms for wireless and NGNs.   Publications  A. Banerjee and M.

(Civil Engineering, and Engineering and Public Affairs) 1974, Carnegie Mellon University  Research Professor Small conducts research on methods for characterizing uncertainty, its implications for regulatory decisions, and the value of information which can lead to reduced uncertainty and improved decision making. Bayesian statistical methods are applied to identify the impact of research and monitoring programs at various stages in an environmental assessment.   Risk perception, communication, and the content and form of decision-support information can have a significant impacts on the behavior of engineers, product designers and consumers, with significant implications for environmental performance and exposure. Integrated environmental performance and exposure models are developed considering both pollutant and human behavior. Results are used for the design of decision-support and risk communication materials. Publications  Riley, D.M., B. Fischhoff, M.J. Small and P.

Without an understanding of such historical background, many attempts at contemporary problem solving are doomed to failure. Professor Tarr is a historian whose research focuses on the history of urban technologies and urban infrastructure systems, as well as the development of environmental problems and policy. More specifically, he has written about the effects of transportation innovations, the uses of the telegraph in the urban context, and the development and impacts of water supply and waste water systems. Professor Tarrs environmental work has dealt also with air, water, and land pollution, and the cross-media problems created by technological choices and changing disposal practices. In addition, Professor Tarr has examined problems of industrial pollution. Professor Tarr has also written about environmental policy formation on the local, state, and federal levels, and the roles of various professional groups in setting priorities. This research has dealt primarily with changing conceptions of risk in the face of new knowledge and new technologies, as well as societal value change. Much of his environmental and technology-related research has been done in collaboration with engineers.

Amir Barati Farimani received his Ph.D. in 2015 in Mechanical Science and Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His Ph.D. thesis was titled “Detecting and Sensing Biological Molecules using Nanopores.” He extensively used atomistic simulations to shed light on the DNA sensing and detection physics of biological and solid state nanopores. Right after that, he joined Professor Vijay Pande’s lab at Stanford. During his post-doc, he combined machine learning and molecular dynamics to elucidate the conformational changes of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). He specifically was focused on Mu-Opioid Receptors to elucidate their free energy landscape and their activation mechanism and pathway.
The Barati Farimani’s lab, the Mechanical and Artificial Intelligence laboratory (MAIL), at Carnegie Mellon University is broadly interested in the application of machine learning, data science, and molecular dynamics simulations to health and bio-engineering problems. The lab is inherently a multidisciplinary group bringing together researchers with different backgrounds and interests, including mechanical, computer science, bio-engineering, physics, material, and chemical engineering. The mission is to bring the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm to mechanical engineering. Traditional mechanical engineering paradigms use only physics-based rules and principles to model the world, which does not include the intrinsic noise/stochastic nature of the system. To this end, the lab is developing the algorithms that can infer, learn, and predict the mechanical systems based on data. These data-driven models incorporate the physics into learning algorithms to build more accurate predictive models. They use multi-scale simulation (CFD, MD, DFT) to generate the data.

Albert Presto is an associate research professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, and a member of the Center for Atmospheric Particle Studies (CAPS). Presto’s research focuses on pollutant emissions from energy extraction and consumption and the subsequent atmospheric transformations that these emissions undergo. Energy production and consumption is a major source of pollutants and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Gas and oil wells emit methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Cars and trucks operating on gasoline and diesel fuels emit carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Particulate matter from mobile sources is largely the result of incomplete or inefficient combustion in the form of organic aerosol and carbon soot. In addition to the direct emissions of pollutants, dilute exhaust undergoes oxidation in the atmosphere. This oxidation chemistry can lead to the production of secondary pollutants, such as ozone and secondary particulate matter.
Presto investigates the contributions of primary and secondary pollution with ambient measurements, laboratory experiments, source testing of pollution sources, and atmospheric models. This multi-pronged and multi-disciplinary approach allows for a holistic view of pollutant emissions and transformations in the atmosphere.
In addition to having environmental impacts, these pollutants, particularly ozone and particulate matter, adversely impact human health. Presto collaborates with medical professionals to develop detailed studies of pollutant exposure on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis, and to better understand the relationships between pollutant emissions and adverse health effects such as childhood asthma.

Sheng Shen is an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, with a background in nanoscale engineering, thermal science, photonics, and materials science. Shen’s research interests include nanoscale thermal transport and energy conversion phenomena, and their applications in solar or thermal energy conversion, thermal management, and multifunctional materials.
The energy transport properties of nanostructures can differ greatly from their bulk counterparts because the characteristic dimensions of nanostructures are often comparable with the wavelength or the mean free path of energy carriers such as photons, phonons, and electrons. At the nanoscale, the properties of materials can be engineered to increase the energy density or energy conversion efficiencies. In his recent research, Shen demonstrated nanoscale thermal radiation exceeding Planck’s law by three orders of magnitude and thermal conductivity of polymer nanofibers three hundred times higher than that of bulk polymers.
Shen is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award (2013) and DARPA Young Faculty Award (2013). He also received the Philomathia Foundation Research Fellowship in Alternative Energy Research from UC-Berkeley (2010), Hewlett-Packard Best Paper Award from ASME Heat Transfer Division (2008), and Best Paper Award from Julius Springer Forum on Applied Physics (2008).

Kenji Shimada is the Theodore Ahrens Professor of Engineering in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. His research and teaching interests are in computer modeling and simulation for product design, analysis, and manufacturing. His research work has focused on geometric computing, emphasizing how to generate, represent, and manipulate geometric information.
Shimada’s recent projects include: physically-based mesh generation; non-manifold geometric modeling; automated shape synthesis using physically-based models; feature-based, dimension-driven surface and solid modeling; collision detection between moving objects; robot motion teaching using interactive computer graphics; and realistic image synthesis using radiosity calculation.
One of Shimada’s current research projects is the closer integration of design and analysis, e.g., automatic conversion of a CAD model to an analysis model, and advanced issues in mesh generation, such as a mesh conversion, anisotropic meshing, adaptive remeshing, and feature-based meshing.
A high-quality mesh is essential in many computer application areas such as FEM and BEM analysis, geometric modeling, and computer graphics. Shimada has developed a new physically-based meshing method, called Bubble Mesh, inspired by observations of efficient packing patterns in nature. The method has been applied in industry in the areas of automobile crash simulation, sheet metal forming simulation, and computer graphics.
Another research project covers new geometric design methodologies such as energy minimizing surface modeling and non-manifold geometric modeling.
These research targets address industry’s immediate and long-term needs for increased design efficiency, higher product quality, and manufacturing cost reduction.

Paul Steif is a professor and associate department head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Steif’s activities focus strongly on engineering education. This includes research to better understand how students learn (or do not learn) basic engineering subjects, and development of educational materials that will help students achieve the necessary, fundamental understanding of engineering subjects.
Much of Steif’s work in engineering education currently addresses learning in statics. Projects, which involve a number of collaborators, include: establishing a conceptual framework for statics; devising tests to assess conceptual understanding in statics and integrating their use into instruction; developing interactive courseware for statics that provides data to students and instructors on learning progress; and working with high school teachers to enrich high school physics instruction with concepts and problems from engineering mechanics.
In a second area of focus, Steif investigates stress development and cracking during cryo-preservation of biological tissues in collaboration with Yoed Rabin and Michael Taylor. One major impediment to cryo-preserving tissues of substantial size are the temperature gradients that accompany cooling and thawing. These temperature gradients can give rise to unacceptably high levels of stresses that cause cracking. This project seeks to combine experimentation and modeling to capture the mechanical behavior of tissues at representative temperatures and predict how such tissues respond to realistic cryo-preservation protocols.

Rebecca Taylor is an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, who specializes in modern manufacturing. Throughout her career, Taylor has been driven by the interplay of form and function in good design. As an undergraduate working on a research project on tethered satellites, she discovered the world of honeycomb composite materials and porous sintered polymers. That is where she first learned that mechanical structure could imbue materials with novel and unexpected properties. After college, while working as a mechanical design engineer, she practiced mechanical device design for reliability and ease of manufacture, working as the primary engineer on both medical products and consumer products. Taylor developed an expertise in rapid prototyping and the broad range of techniques for molding and fabrication, as well as factory control and automation. The interplay between medical tools and biological systems formed the foundation of her interest in research, and that interest drew her back to academia.
When Taylor returned to graduate school, she focused on microfabrication and biomechanics. At the microscale, the force of gravity is negligible, flow is largely laminar and motion is dampened. The microscale world is a universe of its own, and there are countless opportunites for fabrication of novel microstructured materials. During her Ph.D., Taylor fabricated microscale sensors for the functional assessment of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. She utilized sacrificial layers to define the mechanical loading of single heart muscle cells and to perform the first purely axial, contractile force measurements on immature and stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. She calibrated these sensors using piezoresistive cantilevers and achieved both accurate and precise measurements of nanoNewton-level forces. Taylor also created planar, stretchable biosensors that physically route metal traces away from areas of large strain and achieve constant, stretch-independent electrical properties. As a postdoctoral fellow, she worked at the nanoscale, studying the effects of mutations on cardiac contractile protein. In order to study the emergent mechanics of the multiprotein, acto-myosinc contractile system, she has worked to develop a DNA origami-based synthetic cardiac sarcomere that will allow researchers to observe the cooperative behavior of motors as they scale up towards larger, more biomimetic systems.
As a professor, Taylor utilizes DNA origami (bottom up manufacturing) to enable nanomanufacturing and nanomechanics of multiprotein systems. She also continues her investigations into microstructures for biomimetic sensors and actuators (top down manufacturing). The future of manufacturing involves manufacturing across scales, and Taylor is excited to be part of it.
